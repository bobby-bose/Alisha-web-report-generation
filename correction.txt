ERROR ANALYSIS AND CORRECTION GUIDE
====================================

ERROR:
------
sqlite3.OperationalError: table packaging_list has no column named packingListNo

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The database was created with SNAKE_CASE column names (packing_list_no, consignee_address, etc.) 
before the model was updated. The old database file still exists with the old schema.

Now the code is trying to INSERT data into camelCase columns (packingListNo) that don't exist in the database.

SOLUTION - Two options:
-----------------------

OPTION 1 (Recommended - Quick Fix):
Delete the old database file and let Flask recreate it with the new schema.

Steps:
1. Delete file: x:\Web Screenshots\web_forms.db
2. Restart Flask (python main.py)
3. Flask will auto-create a new database with the correct camelCase column names

OPTION 2 (Manual Fix):
Use SQLite to rename the columns in the existing database from snake_case to camelCase.

Commands to run in SQLite:
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN packing_list_no TO packingListNo;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN consignee_address TO consigneeAddress;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN delivery_address TO deliveryAddress;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN exporter_address TO exporterAddress;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN po_number TO poNumber;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN loading_port TO loadingPort;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN discharge_port TO dischargePort;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN hs_code TO hsCode;
ALTER TABLE packaging_list RENAME COLUMN tax_number TO taxNumber;

CODE STATUS:
------------
✓ Model definition is CORRECT - all columns now have explicit camelCase names
✓ Routes are CORRECT - they use camelCase attribute names
✓ Only issue is DATABASE SCHEMA MISMATCH

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
-------------------
Just delete web_forms.db and restart Flask.
